# NSC800_SOL-20
NSC800 CPU adapter for a SOL-200 Computer

I've been entrusted with 2 SOL-20 computers to restore, one of which came with an NSC800 CPU on a homebrew wire wrapped board.

I could not find any reference to using an NSC800 on the SOL-20 so I spent some time with a multimeter reverse engineering the board.

Here you will find the board schematics and a picture of the homebrew with labels on the 4 contact points where it plugs into the computer's main logic board.

I have not laid out a PCB for this yet as it would take a bit of time to line up the headers that plug into the sockets on the main logic board. Feel free to layout a PCB and I'll link to it from here.
